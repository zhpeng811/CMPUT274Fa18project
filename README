Running Instructions:

Gamerules:
For gamemode 1(Classic Mode):
The rule is the same as the classic pacman game. You win by collect all pacdots, if you are caught by the orange ghost, you will lose immediately. If you are caught by other ghost, each game tick 100 points will be subtracted. The player will also lose the game if the points is reduced to 0.

For gamemode 2(Maze Mode):
The rule is to "eat" all ghosts in 50 seconds by walking through the maze.

For gamemode 3(1 VS 1 Mode):
This mode is for 2 players against each other, one is pacman and the other one is pyman. For player who plays pacman use 4 control keys(left key, right key, up key,down key) to control the movements of pacman. For player who plays pyman use key"W",key"A",key"S",key"D" to control the movements of pyman.The game will end if the time is over, or one of the player collides with a ghost. When the time reaches 0, the player with the higher score wins the game. The drawn result happens if both of them get the same score at the end of the game(or both players collides with the ghosts at the same time, this situation is due).

Algorithm:
There are 4 ghosts in the game, and 3 algorithms are applyed. The random algorithm is used so the red and the pink ghosts move randomly. The chasing algorithm for the orange ghost is based on the morning problem 'Manhattan Distance'. How the ghost is going to chase is based on the positions of pacman and the ghost. For example, if the pacman is on the left of the ghost, the ghost will reduce its column position. Determining moving horizontally or vertically based on comparing the horizontal distance and vertical distance. The blue ghost moves in a specific area, it will keep moving in the same direction until it reaches a specific position.


Assumptions:
    1. The user is using either VMWare or Virtual Box to execute the code.

Notes:
    1. In mode 1 and 3, we designed that the chasing orange ghost can move through all inner walls, this is not a bug.
